/**
 * Financial view of Venda de Peças, for the company.
 *
 * Criteria (also in docs/controle-de-pecas.md):
 * - Sales count by the month they were made (Brasília time) and leave out canceled ones.
 * - "Faturamento" is what the technicians owe the company (their price), "vendido" is what the customers paid.
 * - "Custo" is the cost of the parts sold, copied into each sale item when it was made.
 * - "Recebido" is cash: payments registered in the technicians' accounts, by the day they were registered.
 * - "Compras" is cash out: units bought into the central stock × their unit cost.
 * - "Perdas" are the inventory shortages the company absorbs (central stock, or technician shortages it
 *   chose not to charge), at the part's current cost.
 * - The open balance and the stock are positions (a photo), not period flows.
 * - Filtering by technicians narrows sales, payments, losses, balance and the technicians' stock. Purchases
 *   and the central stock belong to the whole company, so they drop out of a filtered view.
